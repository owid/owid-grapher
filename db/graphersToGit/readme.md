# GraphersToGit

This folder is for code related to the upcoming possible move of Graphers from MySQL to GitCMS.

Although that project is not currently in progress, some of the things we need to do for Next also apply to this, so I started this folder now.

Specifically the things we need for Next Operation Merge:

-   Identify all current usage of legacy Grapher features to help with legacy transform code
-   Identify all "exceptional" charts where combinations are being using in an unusual way (i.e. different variable selections for the same entities)
-   See all current Graphers without all default property noise
