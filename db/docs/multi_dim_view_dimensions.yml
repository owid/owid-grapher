        Append-only mapping table that records the dimensions (query parameter key/value pairs)
        for multi-dimensional data page views. Each row maps a chartConfigId to the exact
        dimensions used to generate that view at creation time.

        Useful for analytics, since GA events include the chartConfigID and this table lets
        us recover the associated multi-dim view dimensions.
fields:
    id:
        description: Unique identifier for the mapping row
    chartConfigId:
        description: Chart configuration id for the multi-dim view (chart_configs.id)
    dimensions:
        description: JSON object of multi-dim dimension key/value pairs for this view
