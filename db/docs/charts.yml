metadata:
    description: This table contains our 'standalone' grapher charts, i.e. the charts that are shown on our website at https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/SLUG. Charts represent data visualizations that can be embedded in articles, shared publicly, or used in explorers. Charts use an inheritance system where they can inherit configuration from parent variables.

fields:
    id:
        description: Unique identifier for the chart
    configId:
        description: Foreign key to chart_configs table. Charts store their configuration separately to enable inheritance and efficient updates. The chart_configs table contains the actual config, the slug of the chart etc., so in many queries, these two tables have to be joined.
    isInheritanceEnabled:
        description: When true, chart inherits configuration from parent variable's grapherConfigIdAdmin or grapherConfigIdETL. This allows variables to define default chart settings that are automatically applied to all inheriting charts.
    forceDatapage:
        description: When true, force rendering this chart as a data page using metadata from the first Y indicator.
    createdAt:
        description: Timestamp when the chart was created
    updatedAt:
        description: Timestamp when the chart was last updated
