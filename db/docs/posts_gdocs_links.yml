        Link tracking system for Google Docs posts. All outgoing links and references are tracked here. The target can be things like grapher charts, explorers etc which can be joined via slug.

        Be aware that when joining the charts table on slugs, you need to take chart_slug_redirects into account to get the full picture as a chart with a certain id may have several aliases defined in chart_slug_redirects and this table could link out to any one of these aliases.
