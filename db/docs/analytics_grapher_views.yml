        Grapher view event counts imported from external analytics system.
        Counts how many times each chart was viewed (scrolled into viewport),
        regardless of which page it appeared on.

        Unlike analytics_pageviews (which counts page loads), this table counts
        actual chart visibility events including embedded charts in articles,
        topic pages, and iframes.

        Availability:
        - Production and staging: populated via analytics pipeline
        - Local development: empty by default
