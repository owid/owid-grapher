#
#  docker-compose.grapher.yml
#
#
# This docker-compose file creates a local dev environment for working with grapher. It is meant for
# the general public.
#
# In this setup, you run the node server and vite locally on your machine, and only MySQL is spun up
# and initialized as a dependency.
#
# The mysql database server is exposed on the host at the default mysql port of 3306 so you can use DB admin
# utilities on the host working against localhost:3306. If you are already running MySQL, you will need to
# disable it to use this script to avoid a port conflict.
#
# Before the first run you should download the database dumps. The easiest way to do this is to run the
# following command from a bash terminal with the root of the project as the working directory.
#
#     ./devTools/docker/download-grapher-metadata-mysql.sh
#
# Run `docker-compose up -d` to run all these services in daemon mode. The first time it will take a few minutes
# to build the containers and initialize and fill the database, afterwards it should be up in seconds.
#
# On your local machine, you should copy .env.example to .env, then start `yarn startTmuxServer` or similar
# and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to work with the grapher admin.
#
