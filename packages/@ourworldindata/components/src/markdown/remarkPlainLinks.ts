import { findAndReplace } from "mdast-util-find-and-replace"

// This regex matches:
//   "http"
//   an optional "s"
//   two / characters
//   The subdomains and hostname: Any word or numeric character or "_" or "-" one or more times followed by a period
//   The TLD: Any word or numeric character or "_" or "-" one or more times
//   The path, query string and fragment: A forward slash followed by any word or numeric character (unicode classes so umlauts like รถ match
//       as well as any of the following: .+?:%&=~#) zero or more times. Note that we exclude space even though that is valid in a URL but it tends
//       to make the match too greedy.
//       We match the same subgroup [\p{L}\p{N}_\-.\+/?:%&=~#] twice, once with a * and then excactly once but without interpuncation characters .?:
//       This is to make sure that we don't match trailing punctuation as part of the URL ("This is an http://example.com." - note that the leading
//       period should not be part of the URL)
//       Finally, the very last part is a lone forward slash which would not be matched by the previous subgroup.
