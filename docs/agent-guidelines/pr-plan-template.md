# PR project report

This document is the central place to store all information on the PR that is currently being worked on. Use it to track project progress and store information about the project.

## Goal of this PR

TODO for the human user: tell the agent what to do here - feel free to ramble but try to make sure to add all the relevant context.

Github issue url: TODO for the human user.

## Project progress

This project progress list is a high-level enumeration of the pieces of work that together form this project. If the project is trivial and consists of only a few changes to a single file, remove this section. If the project is bigger, edit this file regularly to keep track of your progress. As a rough guideline, it probably makes sense to create a commit after completing each high level step here. Use your own task list for keeping track of the smaller todo items as you work on one of this list at a time.

Below is an example list of high level phases for a project to add a feature to keep track of physical addresses for each user. Remove this section and replace it by a list that works for the project you are currently working on:

- [ ] Research existing code base.
- [ ] Create database migration to add new addresses table and add database access functions and type defintions
- [ ] Add address section to user details view in admin
- [ ] Add tests for database access functions to dbtest setup

## Development notes

Update this section with bullet points whenever things happen that didn't go according to plan or when you encounter unexpected things in the codebase that create potential edge-cases for the feature you are working on. This list will be used at the end when creating the PR description of the completed work to document approaches that were tried and failed. Note also alternative approaches that were tried but didn't succeed.
